<p>Born in January 1983, living in Osijek - Croatia.
Degree in electrical engineering, lover for all things digital, making a living out of software development. Hopes to find enough quality time one day to seriously dive into hobby electronics (eye on Arduino and Raspberry Pi).</p>

<p>Years of hands-on experience with full-time software development and team management, specializing in eCommerce platforms. Working with Magento as of 2008, knee-deep from its very first beta version. Regularly in touch with all things PHP, database (MySQL) and search/analytics (Solr/Elasticsearch) technologies.</p>

<p>Strong technical knowledge with the ability to communicate those technicalities frequently and clearly with strong direction. Feels comfortable proposing alternatives to demands he feels can be improved, even when this means pulling a late shift to meet deadlines.</p>
